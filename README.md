# SimScale Simulation Projects 🚀

This repository showcases my simulation work using [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/), including structural analysis and upcoming CFD projects.

## 🏗️ Projects

### 1. Crane Stress Analysis
- Tool: SimScale (FEM module)
- Material: Steel
- Load: Gravity + Point Load on Cantilever
- Result: Max displacement ~4 mm
- ✅ Completed with tutorial reference and own setup
- 📍 [View Project Folder](Cantilever-Crane)

### 2. CFD Analysis (Coming Soon)
- Tool: SimScale (CFD module)
- Fluid Flow around an airfoil (planned)

## 🧠 Learnings & Goals
- Learned how to define boundary conditions, meshing, materials, and post-processing.
- Next step: Full CFD simulations for aerospace components.
