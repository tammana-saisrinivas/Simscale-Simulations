# SimScale Simulation Projects 🚀

This repository showcases my simulation work using [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/), including structural analysis and upcoming CFD projects.

## 🏗️ Projects

### 1. Crane Stress Analysis
- Tool: SimScale (FEM module)
- Material: Steel
- Load: Gravity + Point Load on Cantilever
- Result: Max displacement ~4 mm
- ✅ Completed with tutorial reference and own setup
- 📍 [View Project Folder](Cantilever-Crane)
- **📷 Final Result Media:**

### 2. Pipe Junction Flow Analysis
- Tool: SimScale (CFD module)
- Fluid: Incompressible Water
- Setup: Velocity Inlet + Pressure Outlet
- Result: Flow visualization with clear re-circulation zones near junction
- ✅ Completed as first CFD simulation project
